My own solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.  â€”Eric Wastl

This year I am learning Python 3 and familiarizing myself with [Google's Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
